# Analysis of MTA Turnstile Data - Project 1 @Metis

For my first project of Metis Data Science Bootcamp, I was tasked with creating a recommendation for a fictional client (WTWY) regarding how to optimize placement of street teams in subway stations so that they would be able to collect as many signatures as possible for a gala that they were hosting.  It was easy to get carried away in the brainstorming phase, as I thought about how the demographics of the people entering and exiting each station would contribute to how likely WTWY were to get signatures, whether the street teams were able to take advantage of which entries/exits were busier at different times of day, how the limited resources of WTWY might impact the feasibility of my final recommendation, etc...  Ultimately since I was only given a week to complete the entire project, I decided that a ranked list of the busiest stations should be the main focus, and build off of that if I had more time.



## Data and Method

My primary source of data was publicly available MTA turnstile data, which is listed on their site in weekly csv files.  The first challenge was writing a script to pull multiple weeks' worth of data into a single dataframe, and from there I had to calculate the flow of traffic from the data, as the data only showed a simple running counter of entries and exits for each turnstile.  The data was also a bit messy, as there were negative values for traffic flow that I had to throw away, as well as huge outliers that could be a result of turnstile counters resetting to 0 after reaching its maximum value.  After I had a nice clean dataset to work with, I grouped the data by day and by station, and by day of the week.

## Final Recommendation

Given the above information, my final recommendation for the client was to concentrate efforts on the busiest stations in Manhattan, particularly 34th Street-Penn Station and Grand Central-42nd Street.  Priority should be given to weekdays over weekends, especially mid-week.  As for time of day, noon to afternoon saw the most amount of traffic.
